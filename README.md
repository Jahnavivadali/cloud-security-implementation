DESCRIPTION:


For this task, I implemented a comprehensive cloud security setup using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. The objective was to secure cloud resources by configuring **IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies**, **secure data storage**, and **encryption mechanisms** to protect sensitive data.

I began by creating **IAM users, groups, and roles**, assigning them fine-grained permissions through **custom IAM policies** to enforce the principle of least privilege. This ensured that only authorized entities could access specific AWS services or resources.

To secure storage, I utilized **Amazon S3** with **bucket policies** and **block public access settings**. I also enabled **server-side encryption (SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS)** to encrypt data at rest. For data in transit, I ensured HTTPS protocols were enforced.

Finally, I documented the entire setup, including security controls, encryption methods, and access policies, ensuring traceability and compliance with best practices.

This hands-on implementation strengthened my understanding of **cloud security architecture**, **AWS identity management**, and **data protection** strategies.
